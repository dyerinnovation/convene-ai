# Weekly Architecture Review — Task Instructions

> These instructions are read and executed by the CoWork scheduled task.
> Runs every Friday at 4:00 PM.

---

## Process

1. Pull latest code:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Read the full project specification:
   ```
   Read CLAUDE.md thoroughly — this is the source of truth for all design principles.
   ```

3. Read the week's progress:
   ```
   Read docs/PROGRESS.md — focus on entries from the last 7 days.
   Read docs/ROADMAP.md — understand current phase and completion status.
   ```

4. Analyze the codebase:

   **a. Provider abstraction consistency**
   - Check every file in `packages/convene-providers/` — do all implementations correctly extend the ABCs in `packages/convene-core/src/convene_core/interfaces/`?
   - Are there any direct imports of concrete providers in service code? (There shouldn't be — services should use the registry)
   - Are new providers registered in `registry.py`?

   **b. Event-driven architecture**
   - Check all inter-service communication — is it going through Redis Streams?
   - Are there any direct function calls between services? (Violation)
   - Are event definitions in `packages/convene-core/src/convene_core/events/definitions.py` up to date?

   **c. Async correctness**
   - Search for blocking calls in async code paths (`time.sleep`, synchronous DB calls, synchronous HTTP)
   - Verify all database operations use async SQLAlchemy
   - Check for proper `await` usage

   **d. Type safety**
   ```bash
   uv run mypy --strict . 2>&1 | tail -50
   ```

   **e. Test coverage**
   ```bash
   uv run pytest --tb=short -q 2>&1 | tail -30
   ```
   Identify modules with no test files.

   **f. Code organization**
   - Are Pydantic models in convene-core and ORM models alongside their owning service?
   - Are there any business logic leaks into API route handlers?
   - File naming conventions (snake_case, proper module structure)

   **g. Dependency health**
   - Check pyproject.toml files for pinned vs. unpinned dependencies
   - Look for circular dependencies between packages

## Hard rules

- **Never modify code files.** This task is analysis only.
- **Be specific.** Reference exact file paths and line numbers when flagging issues.
- **Prioritize ruthlessly.** Not every finding needs immediate action — rank them.
- **Compare against CLAUDE.md, not personal preferences.** The project spec is the standard.
