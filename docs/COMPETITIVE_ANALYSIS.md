# Convene AI — Competitive Analysis & Market Sizing

---

## Market Sizing

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Convene operates at the intersection of three converging markets:

**AI Meeting Assistants**: Estimated at $2.5–3.7B in 2024, growing at 25–35% CAGR. Projections converge around $7–20B by 2030. This market includes transcription, summarization, action item extraction, and emerging agentic capabilities.

**AI Agents (broad)**: $5–8B in 2025 with the highest growth rate of any adjacent category at 38–46% CAGR, projected to reach $43–53B by 2030. Convene's "agent as team member" positioning sits squarely in this category.

**Voice AI Agents**: $2–3B in 2025, growing at ~35% CAGR to $8–12B by 2030. Currently dominated by customer-facing use cases (support, sales); internal team use cases are underexplored.

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

Convene targets meeting-heavy teams at mid-market companies ($10M–$500M revenue) and 10–50 person startups. Filtering for companies that actively use video conferencing and have budget for team productivity tools, SAM is estimated at **$1.5–2.5B by 2027**.

Key demand-side metrics supporting this estimate:
- 600M+ daily meeting participants across Zoom and Teams alone
- Average US professional spends 10 hours/week in meetings (up 153% since 2020)
- Microsoft Teams has 320M+ monthly active users; Zoom has 300M+ daily participants
- Only 45.8% of companies currently allow AI assistants in collaboration suites — massive room for penetration growth
- Enterprise segment represents 69% of AI meeting market revenue

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Realistic Year 1–2 target: **$2–5M ARR** capturing a fraction of mid-market teams willing to adopt an active (speaking) meeting agent. At $39/seat/month average, this represents 4,000–10,700 paid seats, or roughly 200–500 teams of 20 people.

## Competitive Landscape

### Tier 1: Direct Competitors (Transcription + Task Extraction)

#### Otter.ai
- **Revenue**: ~$100M ARR (2025 estimate)
- **Users**: 25M+
- **Funding**: ~$113M total across Series A-D
- **Pricing**: Free (limited), Pro $16.99/mo, Business $30/mo, Enterprise custom
- **Capabilities**: Real-time transcription, automated summaries, action item extraction, OtterPilot bot joins Zoom/Meet/Teams, "Hey Otter" voice Q&A (announced), Meeting Agent for autonomous SDR (in development)
- **Weaknesses**: Class-action lawsuit (Brewer v. Otter.ai) for recording without consent. Users consistently complain about the bot being "malware-like" — auto-joining meetings uninvited, emailing attendees without permission. No persistent task state across meetings. No agent speaking in meetings.
- **Convene's advantage**: Consent-first design; phone dial-in is transparent; persistent task memory; active voice participation.

#### Fireflies.ai
- **Valuation**: $1B (June 2025 tender offer)
- **Users**: 20M+, 500K+ businesses
- **Funding**: Only $19M in primary funding — reached unicorn primarily through profitability
- **Revenue**: Profitable since 2023, estimated $20-40M ARR
- **Pricing**: Free (limited), Pro $18/mo, Business $29/mo, Enterprise $39/mo
- **Capabilities**: Auto-joins calls, transcribes, creates summaries/action items, "Talk to Fireflies" for in-meeting voice Q&A (powered by Perplexity), AskFred chatbot for post-meeting queries, 50+ integrations, topic detection, sentiment analysis
- **Strengths**: Capital-efficient growth model. Profitable. Strong integration ecosystem. Growing toward agentic capabilities.
- **Weaknesses**: Same "bot creep" problem as Otter. Voice Q&A is reactive (answer questions) not proactive (report progress). No persistent task state. No active meeting participation.
- **Convene's advantage**: Proactive voice participation; cross-meeting task continuity; the agent has its own "to-do list."

#### tl;dv
- **Users**: 1M+
- **Pricing**: Free (unlimited recordings), Pro $20/mo, Business $59/mo, Enterprise custom
- **Capabilities**: Records Zoom/Meet/Teams, AI summaries, action items, recurring meeting reports, CRM integrations, 40+ languages, custom meeting note templates (MEDDIC, SPIN, etc.)
- **Strengths**: Generous free tier drives adoption. Strong template system for sales teams. Good multi-language support.
- **Weaknesses**: Focused on sales/CS use cases. No voice participation. No task persistence across meetings.

#### Sembly AI
- **Pricing**: Free (limited), Pro $10/mo, Team $20/mo, Enterprise custom
- **Capabilities**: AI meeting notes, action item generation, Semblian AI agent for post-meeting queries, supports Google Meet/Zoom/Teams/Webex
- **Weaknesses**: Smaller user base. Limited integrations. No speaking capability.

### Tier 2: Only Direct Competitor for Active Voice Participation

#### MeetGeek — AI Voice Agents (October 2025 Beta)
- **Status**: Public beta, launched October 2025
- **Capabilities**: Agents that join meetings, listen, speak, ask questions, and follow customizable instructions. Templates for AI Scrum Master, AI Recruiter, AI SDR, AI Interviewer.
- **Limitations**: 30-minute speaking cap per meeting. Zoom microphone must be manually unmuted by meeting host. Ad-hoc invitation only (no calendar integration for voice agents). No persistent task state across meetings — each meeting is independent. Currently Zoom-only for voice features.
- **Pricing**: Not separately priced; available on paid MeetGeek plans ($15-29/mo)
- **Assessment**: MeetGeek is the closest competitor to Convene's vision, but their implementation is early and constrained. The 30-minute cap, manual unmute requirement, and lack of cross-meeting memory create significant UX friction. They've validated market interest in speaking agents but haven't solved the hard problems.
- **Convene's advantage**: Phone dial-in requires no manual unmute. Persistent task memory is the core feature, not an afterthought. Platform-agnostic from day one.

### Tier 3: Platform Incumbents

#### Zoom AI Companion
- **Pricing**: Included with paid Zoom plans (no extra cost)
- **Capabilities**: Meeting summaries, action items, smart recording highlights, can join Meet/Teams as a participant, proactive meeting prep (agenda, past action items), "free up my time" calendar optimization
- **Roadmap (announced)**: AI Companion 3.0 (November 2025) adds agentic skills — initiative, reasoning, task action, orchestration. Still text-based sidebar interaction.
- **Threat level**: Medium. Distribution advantage is massive but feature development is slow. Unlikely to offer active voice participation soon — it would conflict with their core meeting UX. Primarily a feature of Zoom Workplace, not a standalone product.
- **Convene's advantage**: Platform-agnostic; deeper task accountability; speaking agent; focused product vs. bundled feature.

#### Microsoft Copilot in Teams
- **Pricing**: $30/user/month add-on to Microsoft 365
- **Capabilities**: Meeting transcription, summaries, action items, Q&A sidebar during meetings, integration with Microsoft 365 suite
- **Threat level**: Medium-high for enterprise. Distribution through Microsoft 365 is unbeatable at the top end. But $30/user/month is expensive for the capability, and it's locked to the Teams ecosystem.
- **Convene's advantage**: Works across platforms; fraction of the cost; active voice participation; not locked to Microsoft ecosystem.

#### Google Gemini in Meet
- **Capabilities**: Meeting notes with Gemini, "take notes for me" feature, audio summaries, Q&A about meeting content
- **Threat level**: Low-medium. Google's meeting AI features lag behind Zoom and Microsoft. Primarily a Workspace upsell.

### Tier 4: Infrastructure / Enabling Platforms

#### Recall.ai
- **Valuation**: ~$250M (Series B, September 2025)
- **Funding**: $51.5M total ($38M Series B led by Bessemer)
- **What they do**: Universal API for meeting bots. Powers 90%+ of third-party meeting AI tools (including many competitors listed above). Processes billions of meeting minutes.
- **Relevance to Convene**: Potential infrastructure partner if we move beyond phone dial-in. Their Output Media feature enables speaking in meetings. But for Phase 1, Twilio dial-in is simpler and cheaper.

#### Pipecat (by Daily.co)
- **Status**: Open source, 10.4k GitHub stars
- **What they do**: Framework for voice and multimodal conversational AI. Pipeline of "Frame Processors" with 40+ AI model integrations. Used by AWS and NVIDIA.
- **Relevance to Convene**: Primary framework candidate for Phase 2-3 voice pipeline. Already has reference implementations of speaking meeting bots (via Meeting BaaS integration).

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: MeetGeek or Otter ships persistent memory + voice before Convene reaches market
**Mitigation**: Speed. Phone dial-in architecture eliminates months of bot engineering. MVP achievable in 3 weeks. The window is 12-18 months before incumbents match the full vision.

### Risk: Meeting platforms crack down on phone bots / revoke dial-in features
**Mitigation**: Dial-in phone bridges are deeply entrenched in enterprise meetings (PSTN participants have been standard for 20+ years). Removing them would break accessibility requirements and enterprise customers. This is the most stable access method available.

### Risk: Privacy backlash against AI meeting participants
**Mitigation**: Consent-first design. The agent introduces itself. Recording consent is explicit. All data is user-controlled and deletable. Position Convene as the "ethical" alternative to silent recording bots. Turn the industry's biggest complaint into a differentiator.

### Risk: AI cost margins compress revenue
**Mitigation**: Batch processing where real-time isn't needed (task extraction can be near-real-time, not instant). Volume pricing with STT/TTS providers. Model size optimization (Haiku for classification, Sonnet for extraction). Phone audio costs less to process than high-fidelity audio.

### Risk: Solo founder execution capacity
**Mitigation**: Claude Code as a force multiplier. Sell the service while building the product — manual meeting analysis consulting validates demand and generates revenue before the product is fully automated. Focus ruthlessly on the core loop (join → listen → extract → remember) and defer polish.
